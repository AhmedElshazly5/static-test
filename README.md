# Intro to the landing Page Project
we're starting the project with a static version composed of HTML+CSS,our goal in this project is to create a mutli-section navigation bar
in a dynamic way by applicating the DOM"Document Object Model" concepts ,for better user experience,I will emphasize the active section and 
also add a feature that makes the browser navigates to the proper sections when the user clicks on the attached navigation link.

## How to run the project locally
the project has an index.html file ,also js/app.js file through which you can  change the code,
a css/style.css though which you can change the style of the page.

## Project specifications 
the file style doesn't rely on bootstrap,only our styles.css file , a few google fonts have been used.

## Project Contents
* the starter files are static version composed of HTML+CSS
* Using the DOM,we can build the navigation bar dynamically
* We will make use of better JS specifications like let,forEach ,etc
* We will use Document Fragment to reduce repaint and reflow and further optimise the performance of the page
* we will dynamically differentiate the action section being viewed using the DOM
